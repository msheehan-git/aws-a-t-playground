# Install Terraform


# MAS OS

1. For MAC OS we'll use brew from a terminal session:

```diff
brew install terraform

```
2. That's it. Now fun with terraform. See [Configure AWS With Terraform](./Configure-AWS-With-Terraform.md)

# Windows

Although AWS and terraform can run in native windows, ansible requires Windows Sub System for Linux (WSL). For consistency you may want to run all three in WSL

1. Install terraform in WSL [https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-developer-community/configuring-terraform-on-windows-10-linux-sub-system/ba-p/393845](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-developer-community/configuring-terraform-on-windows-10-linux-sub-system/ba-p/393845)



# Next up - configure terraform
